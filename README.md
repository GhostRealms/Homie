Some of the planned features include:

- Database (or redis) based /home and /work location setter; with Cross-Server bungeecord support*
- Support for multiple homes with increasing permissions.
- /mark and /return as a simple temporary sethome location; stored in cache
- your suggestions?

 * bungeecord support will be added in a future release.
